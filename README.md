## 📦 Data Source and Dataset Description

* **Data Source:** [Our World in Data - COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data)
  
* **Dataset:** The dataset includes global COVID-19 data such as daily cases, deaths, testing rates, and population metrics.
  
* **Key Columns:**

  * `location`: Country or region
  * `date`: Date of data entry
  * `total_cases`: Cumulative confirmed cases
  * `new_cases`: Daily new cases
  * `total_deaths`: Cumulative deaths
  * `new_deaths`: Daily new deaths
  * `total_tests`: Total tests conducted
  * `population`: Population of the country

---

## 🎯 Objectives of the Analysis

* Analyze the spread of COVID-19 over time for selected countries.
* Compare daily and cumulative cases, deaths, and testing rates.
* Visualize trends using line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps.
* Identify key insights such as top countries by total cases, death rates, and testing rates.

---

## 🛠 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

* Filtered data for selected countries (e.g., Kenya, USA, India).
* Removed missing values and handled data inconsistencies.
* Converted the `date` column to datetime format.
* Filled missing numeric values using forward fill and interpolation techniques.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Line charts for cumulative cases and deaths over time.
* Bar charts for top 10 countries by total cases.
* Heatmaps to analyze correlations between key metrics.

---

## 📈 Visualizations and Insights

1. **Line Charts:** Display trends in total cases and deaths over time.
2. **Bar Charts:** Highlight the top countries by total cases.
3. **Heatmaps:** Show correlation between various numeric columns.

## ✅ Conclusion and Key Takeaways

* The USA recorded the highest number of cases and tests conducted throughout the observed period.
* Kenya showed relatively lower testing rates but maintained lower case counts compared to India and the USA.
* Correlation analysis indicated that higher testing rates were associated with higher confirmed cases.
